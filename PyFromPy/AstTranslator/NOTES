Packages are unimplemented -- lookups are complicated, but route
No plans to support multiple inheritance
No plans to support metaclasses
Actually, no plans to support inheritance
New-style classes only, (even though it doesn't make a difference)
__slots__ is just more work

I'm not even sure what Elipsis does, or ExtSlice
We're just going to do subscript and slices[start:end]

Yo, deal with builtins

I'm considering using closures for captures
this may be a code generation issue

We're almost certainly not going to support cyclicic gc at this point

So apparently globals() and locals() are normal functions, that just so happen to look at their calling frame.  One way or another, I think we'll have to maintain an explicit stack
If we're lucky, we can use C++'s.  Because of this, I'm making the assumption that globals() or locals() can be called anywhere, anytime.
Some analysies will simply not run on any program that uses globals or locals anywhere.  The analysis to determine locals/globals usage is just too complicated to be complete, even if it is extremely conservative, and it's super edgecase-ish.

Ok so one good thing is that globals/locals are in __builtins__, which aren't actually in globals() by default.  Thus, we can *probably* just track if globals/locals are gotten but not immidiately called.  Even doing so, there are some caveats, mostly from doing something to get all of __builtins__, which can lead to globals/locals escaping to the outside world.
